  Abstract
</h3>
<p>
  Board games have been a popular form of entertainment for generations. It is rare to enter a household and find no board games of any kind. However, as the world becomes increasingly technology-oriented, so too become games. From game systems to computers, entertainment is moving increasingly on screens and online. This does not mean that board games are becoming obsolete; rather, there has been a surge of digital versions of board games that are available online or as applications. There are thousands of beloved board games still waiting to be programmed and playable on the computer. My project aims to help streamline this endeavor by providing an API for developers of board games to use. Many board games have similar or the same components: a board, players, and game pieces, for example. If these components can be abstracted away, while still being flexible enough for various types of usage, then developers can focus on writing game logic instead of writing the same code over and over again for the same core components. This means that in the end, it will be easier and faster for developers to bring more board games to our fit our new technology.
